## Why did we choose this topic?

We choose Evernote because it had a wide variety of functions to explore. Our goal was to utilize their basic operations to beginners and students that are looking for a friendly note taking app.

## Why did we choose this theme?

We choose this theme because it kept all the sections organized and overall the website had a clean layout for readability.

## How did we collaborate during this time?

We began writing our set of tasks and created screenshots for more clarity.
Initially, we collaborated in person to work on the project.
Due to the recent COVID-19 situation, it we transistion to remote and started collaborating online.
Using online communication such as Slack and Zoom helped keep each other in sync.

## What are some things we learned?

* Writing markdown files
* Utilizing Jekyll theme

Some jekyll themes are written differently so we had to read through the documentation to fully grasp how to input our part.


## What were some difficulties when creating this guide?

* Resizing the images
* Making the tables
* Spacing everything
* Formatting code in jekyll theme is different

Again, formatting the markdown on Github compared to the jekyll website was different. We managed to overcome the challenge by reading their documentation to understand their formatting style. We tested multiple methods to make sure its readable with proper amount of spacing. In addition, we had to resize some images for more clarity.
